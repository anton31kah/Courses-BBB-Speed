# Courses BigBlueButton Recordings Speed Watcher
This extension is useful in case you want to watch the recordings faster.

Now I know many extensions already exist [like this one](https://github.com/codebicycle/videospeed) which I personally use.
But the recordings on BBB sometimes use two video files, one for the webcam (or audio), and one for the video in case it's a screen share.
In this case you can't change the speed properly using the extension as you'd have to change the speeds in two places simultaneously.
This extension is very simple, it simply changes the speed of all the video elements at the same time, well, to be precise, in a loop, but it's still way much faster than you could click.

If you want to achieve the same thing but not use this extension then pause the lecture, increase the speed using a different method (maybe you already have that extension I mentioned installed), and resume the playback.

Another thing this extension offers is changing the time of the video by 10 seconds, just like the extension I mentioned.

As you can see this extension is like an extension to the extension I mentioned.

## Usage
- Simply download the extension and start using it. It's extremely simple.

## Download
- For Firefox you can download the extension from [the releases page](https://github.com/anton31kah/Courses-BBB-Speed/releases/latest).
- Note that the extension won't appear in pages which aren't the BBB recording page.
